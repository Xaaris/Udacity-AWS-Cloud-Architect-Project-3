Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1: Web Service Instance in public subnet
The Web Service Instance should be placed inside the private VPC instead of the public one.
Even though it is called the "Trusted Public Subnet", there shouldn't be something like a trusted subnet.
As this instance does not need to be accessible from the internet directly, it can be placed inside the private subnet.


# Poor practice 2: Access to S3 buckets via the Internet
The S3 buckets, as configured in the diagram are accessible from the internet.
This shouldn't be the case and the buckets should rather be accessed via VPC endpoints by the Web Service Instance.
THis way it can be better controlled and audited who has access to what resources.
